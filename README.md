# Build your own custom RESTful API

#### How to use this repo ( Beginner Guide )

- First clone or fork the repositor to your local machine
- Make sure you have MongoDB and NodeJS installed and set up. 
- You can use [Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) to add the sample data to your database or you can use an API development tool to post data to your database. 
- In your project directory run ```npm install`` to install the packges needed for this project ```express, body-parser, mongoose, ejs```
- Run ```node app.js``` to spin up the server and check the port your server is listening to, in this it's listening to port 3000
- Download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) which makes API development easy and quick. It simplifies the whole thing and I personally can't recommend it more.
- Finally, you are all set. Now you can start sending requests and testing ```GET POST PUT PATCH DELETE```
